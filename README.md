# Houstan we have lift-off

Houstan is the public repo for My Home Lab. It is currently version 0.01 *USE AT OWN RISK*

## Command Center



- Bare Metal Provisioning & Management
- Virtual Machine Provisioning & Management
- Secrets Management
- Identity & Authentication Management
- Infrastructure Access Management
- File System & Sync Management

In my case, I have installed Ubuntu Desktop on a Microsoft Surface Go that I use as my command center as it sits on my living room table, always on. I use this as I also have Home Assistant running on this machine and I like the touch screen display for this use case. If you don't need that, even a RaspPi would work.

### Backups of the Command Center OS Image are Vital.

## Apps

Home Lab application management system. 

- Home Automation
- Media Servers
- Private Clouds
- Office Apps
- Design Software
- etc

## Infrastructure

### Command-Center

A basic scaffold will look something like:

- Facility Management
  - Maps
  - Machines
    - Bare Metal Provisioning
    - Virtual Machine Provisioning
    - Cloud Provisioning
  - Networking
    - Cabling
  - 
  - Remote Access
  - Maintenance
  
- Workload Management
  - Bare Metal Management
  - Container Management
  - Cluster Management
  - Openstack
  - Kubernetes


*This whole project is in early development, but the underlying technologies will not be. Use this (if even working) at your very own risk. I will constantly be making changes (most likely breaking)*
