# Houstan
Houstan is the public repo for My Home Lab.

There are three sections to my Home Lab.

## AccessPoint

AccessPoint holds the programs and scripts that are used for Local Infrastructure provisioning such as:

Bare Metal Provisioning & Management
Virtual Machine Provisioning & Management
Secrets Management
Identity & Authentication Management
Infrastructure Access Management


This whole project is in early development, but the underlying technologies will not be. Use this (if even working) at your very own dumb risk.
