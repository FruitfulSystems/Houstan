# Houstan

Houstan is the public repo for My Home Lab.

I aim to use all open source technologies.

This is implemented for x86-64 architectures.

There are three sections to my Home Lab.

## Command Center

Command Center holds the programs and scripts that are used for Local Infrastructure provisioning from a single machine (X86-x64 Architectures).
The point is to have an "always on" machine such as:

- Bare Metal Provisioning & Management
- Virtual Machine Provisioning & Management
- Secrets Management
- Identity & Authentication Management
- Infrastructure Access Management

## Home Base

Home Base contains programs and scripts for my home base programs such as:

- Home Automation
- Media Server
- Private Cloud

## Laboratory

Laboratory is the portion of my home lab that is meant to mimic a commercial environmnt as possible. In terms of architecture, not proprietary software. 

A basic scaffold will look something like:

- Bare Metal Provisioning
- Nomad Cluster Management
- Openstack
- Kubernetes
- Business Applications

This whole project is in early development, but the underlying technologies will not be. Use this (if even working) at your very own risk. I will constantly be making changes (most likely breaking)
